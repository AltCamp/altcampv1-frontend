# CSS Guidelines

1. Use vanilla CSS for styling and avoid using preprocessors such as Sass or Less.
2. Use a consistent naming convention (e.g. BEM, SMACSS) for class names.
3. Use the CSS variables for reusable values such as colors, font sizes and others as specified in the index.css file.
4. Use CSS grid and flexbox for layout, avoid using frameworks such as Bootstrap or TailwindCSS.
5. Use media queries for responsive design, avoid using JavaScript for this purpose.
6. Use CSS animations sparingly and make sure they are performant and accessible.
7. Avoid using !important, except in rare cases where it is absolutely necessary.
8. Write clean, organized, and well-commented code.
9. Test your CSS in all relevant browsers and devices.
10. Follow the project's existing CSS conventions and style.
